      <p>
        I'm a 4th year Computer Science Student. This is my final semester at IIT and will be graduating in May of 2023. I have some experience in html and css and I'm hoping this class will give me a deeper understanding. This website is going to serve as a way to show my progress and labs that I will be completing in ITMD 361.

        This is where I put most of my lab files and other projects that I have worked on. Some projects are private because I'm currently working on them or it was for a company that didn't want me sharing the source code.

          The longest one-syllable words in the English language are "scraunched" and "strengthed." Some suggest that "squirreled" could be included, but squirrel is intended to be pronounced as two syllables (squir-rel) according to most dictionaries. "Screeched" and "strengths" are two other long one-syllable words, but they only have 9 letters.
